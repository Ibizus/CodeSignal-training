// You're given three integers, a, b and c. It is guaranteed that two of these integers are equal to each other. 
// What is the value of the third integer?

// Example

// For a = 2, b = 7, and c = 2, the output should be
// solution(a, b, c) = 7.

// The two equal numbers are a and c. The third number (b) equals 7, which is the answer.

function solution(a: number, b: number, c: number): number {
    return a===b? c : a===c? b : a;
}


console.log(solution(2, 7, 2));
